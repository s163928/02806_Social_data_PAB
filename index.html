						According to the Bureau of International Recycling, recycling is a $200 billion industry. With
						recycling being perceived as a governmental responsibility, instead of a personal one, around
						21.2 million tons of recyclable waste goes unrecycled every year. Around 300 million tons of
						plastic are produced every year with only 91% being recycled <a
							href="https://blog.repurpose.global/recycling-facts-from-around-the-world/#:~:text=Recycling%20is%20a%20%24200%20billion,the%20Bureau%20of%20International%20Recycling">[1]</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						This quite clearly illustrates that recycling is far more important that most people are
						inclined to believe. It not only helps conserve natural resources but also reduces toxic wastes
						and environmental pollution, all of which enhance the long run sustainability of our world.
						Plastic bottles can be reused as carpets, clothing, auto parts, just to name a few. This is also
						why it has become part of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the UN as goal
						number 12, responsible consumption and production. While we are recycling more materials than
						ever before, the numbers are slowing down according to the United States Environmental
						Protection Agency (EPA) <a

				New York alone produces around 3.2 million tons of trash, with infrastructure to handle it being a major
				concern. There have been many cases of illegal trash dumping causing outrage among the city’s citizens
				<a href="https://www.citysignal.com/what-a-waste-new-york-citys-trash-and-recycling/">[3]</a>.
				As you might therefore imagine, the city recycles only about a fifth of its garbage. Around 25 % from
				businesses and 18 % domestic waste <a
					href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/nyregion/nyc-recycling.html">[4]</a>.
				According to mayoral spokesperson Kate Smart, the mayor of New York city is committed to implement
				creative solutions to reach its sustainability goals of nearly zero-ing out residential waste by the
				year 2030. “To fully address climate change, we must significantly reduce New York City’s waste in an
				efficient and effective way,” says the mayoral spokesperson. According to an analysis done by the
				Department of Sanitation in 2017, more than two-thirds of domestic waste could be diverted from
				landfills and incinerators if New Yorkers meet their recycling potential. Meanwhile Council Member Chi
				Ossé comments on the fact that recycling isn’t only an environmental issues “this is a racial justice
				issue; and just like the mayor’s favorite two words — this is a public safety issue,” <a
					href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/22/zero-waste-new-yorkers-recycle-00026708">[5]</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				But with New York being notorious for its recycling infrastructure, who are those that actually do so?
				And who are those that don’t? Those that don’t recycle could be faced with a lack of incentive,
				knowledge, infrastructure or time. But do things like ethnicity, gender and income affect these
				behavioral patterns? How much does the number of recycling bins in one’s surrounding or population
				density affect how much a person recycles?
				By analyzing data from NYC Open Data <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">[6]</a> we hope to be
				able to answer the question “Which societal factors impact recycling patterns?”. We hope to figure out
				where education or environment changes would lead to the biggest impact in recycling behavior.
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
				So. Who is it that recycles?

				<h2>Getting Into It</h2>
			</header>

			<p>
				In order to best be able to see which societal factors impact recycling patterns the ideal dataset would
				include individual people's information. Unfortunately such data is hard to come across. The data we are
				going to be looking at is divided into 5 of New York boroughs being Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens
				and Staten Island. The main societal factors that we will be investigating are gender, ethnicity and
				income.
			</p>
			<h3>
				NYC’s Men and Women
			</h3>
			<p>
				Let’s dive in to see the basic statistics of our New York City data by first looking at the gender
				ratios in New York City. Note that there are only records of two genders in the given dataset. In the
				city as a whole, there is not a big difference in the number of men and women. The number of men is
				around 9.6 million while the number of women is around 10.2 million. The statistics for each borough can
				be seen on figure INSERT FIGURE NUMBER. It shows that the amount of men and women are quite similar,
				with the female population being slightly greater than mens. Since the numbers in the given dataset are
				so close, it will be difficult to pinpoint the impact each gender has on recycling patterns, even though
				there might be significant differences.
			</p>
			<span style="width: 50%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="image fit"><img
					src="images/men_women_total_number_borough.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				By diving deep into the gender aspect, we can check whether or not there is a significant difference in
				the income between men and women, that could impact their recycling patterns. A graph comparing the
				median household income between men and women can be seen on figure INSERT FIGURE NUMBER. Even though
				there are some differences, there is nothing major to noise. Based on the discoveries of gender count
				and income in the given dataset, gender won’t be considered as a major factor when analyzing the data
				further.
			</p>
			<span style="width: 70%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="image fit"><img
					src="images/female_male_income.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p></p>
			<h3>
				The Diverse People of NYC
			</h3>
			<p>
				New York is filled with different ethnicities with Hispanic, White, Black and Asian people being the
				majority. This can be seen on figure INSERT FIGURE NUMBER. It is interesting to notice the rather major
				gaps between the number of people from different ethnicities living in the city. With people of white
				ethnicity being the predominant one and asian ethnicity the least common one, if we exclude native and
				pacific, which are nearly zero percent.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is even more interesting to look at the difference in ethnicity count between boroughs. This can be
				seen on figure INSERT FIGURE NUMBER. In Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island, people of white
				ethnicities are a majority. In some of them, by far. You can see that 60% of the people on Staten Island
				are white and close to 50% of people are white in Manhattan. In the Queens however, people of hispanic
				ethnicity are a majority. The same goes for the Bronx but here under 10% of the population is white.
				Having these major differences between each borough makes it much easier to investigate the impact that
				ethnicities have in recycling patterns, than e.g. with the gender data as mentioned earlier.

			</p>
			<div class="row gtr-150">
				<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ethnicity_percantage_NYC.png" alt="" /></span>

				<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ethnicity_percantage_NYC_boroughs.png" alt="" /></span>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				As shown on figure INSERT FIGURE NUMBER there is clearly a different overall pattern in income.
				Especially in the section with very high income it is clear to see that there are more white people than
				hispanic people. This could therefore be an important factor to keep in mind later on. Here the decision
				of comparing these two ethnicities was due to the fact that they are the two ethnicities that are
				dominant in the neighborhoods. White people are predominant in three; Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten
				Island, while Hispanic people are predominant in The Bronx and slightly in Queens.

				<h2>What a Waste!</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				We already discussed how the city looks in terms of distribution of different ethnicities and
				genders in
				different boroughs as well as the city as a whole. But what about recycling? Are any of the
				social
				factors we have discussed affecting the amount of recycling is done in each borough?
			</p>

			<div class="row gtr-150">
				<div class="col-7 col-12-medium">


					<p>
						Figure [figure number] shows the different recycling rates for each borough. To give a bit more
						insight
						into the data we are looking at, let’s understand what this all is showing. The diversion rate
						shows the
						fraction of waste that is recycled of all waste in the city’s stream. The capture rates however,
						show
						that fraction of what is recycled of that which is captured. So paper diversion rate is total
						recycled
						paper divided by maximum paper in the city's stream. Others refers to a mixture of metal, glass,
						plastic
						and beverage cartons. The totals is the mean of the two other capture rates.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before we are able to connect social factors with peoples recycling patterns, we also have to
						take into
						account that it might physically be possible for them to recycle. Many people might not have a
						car and
						find it difficult to transport their waste to a recycling station or bin from their home.
						Especially if
						the distance is very large. Looking into each borough and their recycling bins, we find that
						there are
						most bins placed in Brooklyn and fewest bins placed in Staten Island. This can be seen in figure
						INSERT
						FIGURE NUMBER. The amount of bins that Brooklyn has is almost 5 times more. The distance between
						each
						bin should also be accounted for and that can be seen on figure INSERT FIGURE NUMBER. This shows
						that
						Staten Island still has the largest distance to a bin, however it shows that Manhattan and not
						Brooklyn
						has the shortest distance between bins.
					</p>

					src="images/recycling_rates_NYC_boroughs.png" alt="" /></span>
			-->


			<p>
				In order to get an idea if there are too many pins placed in a borough, we need to look at the
				population density for each borough. This can be seen on figure INSERT FIGURE NUMBER. From this we see
				that the bin density and the population density has a nice correlation in each borough. This means that
				the amount of bins and their placement should give the people in each borough a fairly similar
				opportunity to recycle.
			</p>

			<p>
				However it shows that Staten Island has the highest recycling rate of all of the boroughs, but the
				fewest number of recycling bins and fewest number of people. This raises the question of whether people
				on Staten Island go out of their way to recycle, if the environment makes it relatively easier for them
				or if the social factors have the biggest impact? Perhaps people in Staten Island are more likely to
				have a car which they utilize when dropping recyclables off? As mentioned earlier Staten Island is also
				the borough with the highest ratio of white people with just above 60% of the population.
			</p>

			<div class="row gtr-150">
				<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/borough_bin_density.png" alt="" /></span>

					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/borough_population_density.png" alt="" /></span>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				The borough with the lowest recycling rate is Bronx, where over half of the people living there are
				hispanic. The Bronx has a relatively average amount of recycling bins and bin density, so why ain’t the
				people living there not as good at recycling as Staten Island? Again the environment factors such as
				owning a car might be a significant factor.
			</p>

			<p>
				The borough with the highest number of bins per square meter is Manhattan, but Manhattan comes third of
				the boroughs when comparing the recycling rates. This might show that even though they seem to have the
				best opportunities to recycle, other factors most clearly have an impact on people’s recycling patterns.

				<h2>Let’s Talk Money</h2>
			</header>

			<p>
				We’re throwing money into the equation. Now we know that Staten Island recycles a bunch, but the Bronx
				does less, and that there is a difference in ethnicity ratios in these boroughs. We also know that
				having more recycle bins does not necessarily cause people to recycle more. If we look at the income per
				capita between boroughs, Manhattan has the highest number by far, they also had the most recycling bins,
				but they land in the middle of the boroughs when we compare the recycling rates. Manhattan has the
				second highest ratio of people of white ethnicity, or a little below 50%. The Bronx has the lowest
				income per capita. As discussed above, Bronx is also the borough with the highest ratio of people from
				hispanic ethnicity, and the only borough where people from hispanic ethnicity are a majority. The Bronx
				was also the borough with the lowest recycling rate.
			</p>
			<span style="width: 50%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="image fit"><img
					src="images/income_per_capita_boroughs.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				What does this all mean? Is there a correlation between income, recycling and ethnicity? Is it possible
				to predict income, based on the factors discussed? We trained a machine learning model to predict the
				total income per capita based on factors seen in [insert something to cite the feature importance plot].
				Here, you can see that being of white ethnicity is the most important deciding factor on your total
				income. Our model predicted the total income, based on these features, with around 80% accuracy.
			</p>
			<p>
				When looking at the correlation between ethnicity, recycling rates, income, bin density and more, it
				becomes evident that being white is positively correlated with your income. Furthermore, being white is
				positively correlated with all the metrics used to measure recycling. The density of bins per square
				meter is also positively correlated with the total income per capita. However, the density of bins is
				not positively correlated with the recycling metrics, meaning that having more bins per square meter
				does not cause people to recycle more.

				<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
			</header>

			<p>
				But what does this mean? Does being of white ethnicity directly impact how much you recycle? Or
				how much
				money you make? Can people really impact how much they recycle, or is their ability to recycle
				decided
				by social factors they can not really impact themselves?
			</p>
			<div class="row gtr-150">
				<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">

					<p>
						All we know is that it’s not equally likely that you recycle if you have high income versus low
						income.
						Whether that income is directly affecting your ability to recycle is a complicated question and
						a lot of
						other factors might be affecting the result. How about gender? We proved that there was a
						statistical
						difference in the income for men and women. Does being born female decrease your likelihood of a
						higher
						salary? According to the numbers, it does. What about ethnicity? We proved that there is a
						statistical
						difference in the total income for people of white ethnicity and people of asian ethnicity.
						Again,
						according to the numbers, ethnicity does directly impact your likelihood of higher salary.
					</p>
					<p>
						Recycling can be a privilege. If you have a job that pays well, you can afford to live in a more
						expensive place in the city. A more expensive place in the city results in a higher number of
						recycling
						bins per capita, making it easier for you to run to the next recycling bin. It’s important that
						recycling is made easy for everyone, by increasing the number of recycling bins in low-income
						areas of
						the city.
